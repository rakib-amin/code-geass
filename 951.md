#### Question
For a binary tree T, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

A binary tree X is flip equivalent to a binary tree Y if and only if we can make X equal to Y after some number of flip operations.

Write a function that determines whether two binary trees are flip equivalent.  The trees are given by root nodes root1 and root2.

#### Solution

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean flipEquiv(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        if(root1 == null || root2 == null) return root1 == root2;
        return root1.val == root2.val && 
            (flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.left) && flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.right) ||
             flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.right) && flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.left));
    }
}
```
#### Learnings
##### When to use dfs
- Same condition applies for all the nodes. 
- Each level can feed data to it's parents
- return statement is possible: What happens when I reached leaf? what do I check?
